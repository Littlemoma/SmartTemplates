<b>Enhancements / Changes</b>
<ul>
  <li> The button in the email header bar is now shorter not containing the untranslated  phrase 'Follow up with SmartTemplates' anymore -  you can even completely hide the SmartTemplates  label so that only the icon remains visible while  in icon+text mode. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/254">[issue 254]</a>  </li> 
  <li> Added "settings" item to bottom of SmartTemplates thread tools menu </li>
</ul>

<b>Bugs Fixed</b>
<ul>
  <li> A problem was fixed that prevented other account templates loading when you change the 'From' address in the email editor window.  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/256">[issue 256]</a>

However there will be a prompt now, as Thunderbird currently incorrectly reports a New Email as "changed" when the event happens. We're hoping that this problem may be addressed in a future version.
  </li>
</ul>
