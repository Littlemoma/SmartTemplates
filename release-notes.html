<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/171">[issue 171]</a> SmartTemplates Settings Dialog: Empty Examples tab in Thunderbird 91. This was caused by Thunderbird 91 enabling multi-process browsing which doesn't allow remote iFrames. Examples are now loaded in a browser element instead. Note that the examples are pulled from the support site and as such are always in English only.</li>
