SmartTemplates is now compatible with the latest version of Thunderbird (115.0). This required numerous substantial changes, and rewriting of many functions. This version 3.17.1 backports some of the changes to Thunderbird 102 and earliser.

We frequently need to import text fragments ("building blocks") that have a generic message but need to include some specific keywords, such as a product name or URL. Previously the following pattern did not work within the text that is imported:

<pre>%file("snippets/why-renew.html")%
%replaceText("{addonName}","quickFilters")%    
%replaceText("{github}","https://github.com/RealRaven2000/quickFilters")%</pre>

Contained file (why-renew.html)

<pre>&lt;p&gt;
  All changes of the Add-on {addonName} can be seen as they are 
  created and tracked &lt;a href="{github}/issues"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

Previously, SmartTemplates did the replacements <b>before</b> the contents of the file were inserted into the template text. 
New behavior: First load the file and replace its contents into the template, then do the text replacements afterwards. As demonstrated in the example above, it can also be used to modify HTML markup and affect things like HTML attributes such as the URL of a web link.
</li>

  
<li> Fixed problem where an invalid HTML signature path could lead to problems in the template.  </li>
<li>Update Number of days left in license at midnight</li>
</ul>
