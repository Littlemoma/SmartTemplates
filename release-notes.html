SmartTemplates is now compatible with the latest version of Thunderbird (115.2.3). This required numerous substantial changes, and rewriting of many functions. This version 3.17.1 backports some of the changes to Thunderbird 102 and earliser.

<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li> New option to inject contents of <code class="html">&lt;head&gt;</code> tags into the Thunderbird composers' head section. Merge attributes of template <code class="html">&lt;body&gt;</code> into the body tag of the Email. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/79">[issue 79]</a>

Thunderbird used to discard any body tags that were injected into composer. With this new feature we can influence the look and feel of the page better (including background color and images). Moving style sections into the head of the email can also make the layout translate better in various email environments. Some webmail sites discard styles that are not located within the head section.

This behavior can be toggled on the advanced settings page. </li>
</ul>

<b>Bugfixes</b>
<ul>
<li> Avoid error in log when smartTemplates.json file (list of external templates) does not exist <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/227">[issue 227]</a>  </li>
<li> Fixed a problem with cardbook when no match round and fallback to standard AB is not defined </li>
</ul>
