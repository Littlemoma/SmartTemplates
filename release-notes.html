<b>Latest News</b>

I have rewritten SmartTemplates for compatibility with Thunderbird 78. We had a few 1000$ costs for my Add-on migrations. The main effort for new features and bug fixes will go into this new version - latest version is <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/smarttemplate4/versions/?page=1#version-3.5.4">3.5.4</a>. 

I may backport some fixes / features for Thunderbird 60-68 in the SmartTemplate version 2.*. See the item lists below for more detail.

If you are interested in using a version of SmartTemplates that works with Thunderbird 78 and later, consider
