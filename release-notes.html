<b>Maintenance Release 3.15.1</b>
Minor maintenance fix for text search in variables tab that could break repeated searching using F3.


<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
<li>
Added backwards search in variables window - press [Shift] + [F3]to search text going up. You can also use the [Enter] key on the number pad to enter a new search term. This previously closed the SmartTemplates settings window</li>
<li>Added optional attributes list to variable %file()% when it is used to include images , see <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/216">[issue 216]</a>.
You can add additional attributes to like this:

%file(img/bargain.png,id=bargainStar,width=192,"alternative text")%
This will generate the following html code after importing the image data:
&lt;img
src="data:img/png;filename=bargain.png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAAN...." id="bargainStar" width="192" alt="alternative text"&gt;</li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes / Maintenance</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem with <tt>addressbook</tt> switch, which can be used with address headers and also %identity%. This was broken by recent changes related to <code class="inline">toclipboard</code>. Also added support for the new vCard format. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplates/issues/217">[issue 217].</a> Example:

%identity(addressbook,work.title,work.department,work.organization)%
</li>
</ul>
