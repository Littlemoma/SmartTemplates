<h3>troubleshooting fonts and layout</h3>

<p>Sometimes when composing / reading emails, fonts or colors do not turn out as expected. 
This is hard to troubleshoot for us but you can use the built in tools of Thunderbird to investigate.</p>

        <p>If you need to find out what causes the font "look" on
          a specific section in your emails, open <i>Tools / Developer Tools &gt; Developer Toolbox </i>on
          the Thunderbird main menu (or press CTRL+SHIFT+I):<br>
        </p>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/menu-inspector.png" class="screenshot" alt="starting inspector"></p>
        <p>(1) Next, click on the "inspector" tab:</p>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/inspector.png" class="screenshot" alt="starting inspector"></p>
        <p>(2) optional step - you only need this if you want to click
          in Composer or a separate "single message window" - select a
          target document. By default this is the mail 3pane
          (<i>messenger.xul</i>). To investigate the composer window, pick <i>messengercompose.xul</i><br>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/kb-inspector-target-doc.png" class="screenshot" alt="target document selector"></p>
        <p></p>(3) Picker<br>
				   use this to select what you are interested in with your mouse. regions of interest will be highlighted
					 with a red frame.
				</p>
        <p>(4) Click on the writing on the page in composer / preview</p>
        <p>On the left of Inspector, you see the "document tree" - the different parts that make up your email 
				   - click any element to select a different paragraph which will be highlighted on screen</p>
        <p>On the right hand of the screen you can select different views:</p>
        <h2>Rules <br>
        </h2>
        <p>this shows all style rules that apply to the selected element<br></p>				
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/kb-inspector-rules.png" class="screenshot" alt="rules section"></p>
				
        <p>If a rule is overridden by another, it will be "crossed out":<br/>
           <img src="screenshots/kb/kb-inspector-style-override.png" class="screenshot" alt="overridden styles"></p>
        <p>You can filter for specific rules with the "Filter Styles"
          box on top:</p>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/kb-inspector-filter-styles.png" class="screenshot" alt="filter style rules"></p>
        <p>You can try out other values by double-clicking the values of ach rule and then typing over. 
				   Make sure to transfer the new rules to your template.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Computed Styles</h2>
        <p>Shows only the styles that "survive" in the hierarchy of styles<br></p>
        <p><img src="screenshots/kb/kb-inspector-computed.png" class="screenshot" alt="computed styles section">
				</p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>This section deals mainly with positioning of the element on
          screen:<br>
        </p>
