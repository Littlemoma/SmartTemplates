<h2 class="page-header">SmartTemplates :: Add-on Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>No Software is without trouble.</p>
<p>
  We try to publish software with less of trouble for you but if you have some, we <i>highly recommend</i> to install the 
  <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/1815/" title="Console&#178; Add-on on ATN" target="_blank">Console&#178;  Add-on</a> first.
  <br>
	<b>Thunderbird 60 and earlier:</b> Please install the <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/smarttemplate4/console2-1.0a10.xpi">patched version here</a> for contemporary builds 
	of Thunderbird (45 and higher - now compatible with Thunderbird 60.4.0).<br>
  Console&#178; has more detailed options for the logging process than the default error console of Thunderbird.
	If you do want to use the built in error console, be aware that it may be a little harder to
	set up what it actually displays. By default it may not give you what you need for Add-on troubleshooting.</p>
  <p><b>Thunderbird 68 and later</b>
    you have to use the built in Javascript error console, which cnan be invokled from the Tools menu: 
    Select Developer Tools / Error console or press Ctrl+Shift+J
  

<h3>Console&#178; Configuration - Thunderbird 60 and earlier only</h3>
<p><b>1.</b> Click on "<u>O</u>ptions" in the top right corner of Console&#178; Window and select the following options:<br>
  <img src="/screenshots/support/console2Options.png" class="screenshot" title="Console2 Options" alt="">
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Click the "<u>A</u>ll" button on top left of Console&#178; Window to see those entries inside the Log Window only<br>
</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Disable the  "Content" logging using the 5th button on the second toolbar below. This will make sure to remove any "noise"
      introduced by errors in the emails themselves. Usually we do not need these error messages as they only muddy the waters<br>
  <img src="/screenshots/support/console-optimal-settings.png" class="screenshot" title="Console2 Window Options" alt="">
</p>


<p><b>4.</b> Often it is necessary to provide more context - you can tell SmartTemplates to log more information of what it does. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Please activate the debug option on the bottom of SmartTemplates &#8658; Advanced &#8658; Global Settings Tab.<br>
<img src="/screenshots/support/st4GlobalSettingsTab.png" class="screenshot" title="SmartTemplates Global Seetings Tab" alt=""><br>
  Note: there may be a warning on "voiding the warranty" - you can ignore this as I made it safe by displaying
	our debug options only.
</li>
<a name ="debugOptions"> </a>
<li> You can create additional more specific messages by right-clicking the debug checkbox and activating additional options (double click on the entry).
     Please do not activate everything as this will make the log unreadable also - if you send us a support email
		 we can usually advise what debug options to activate.<br>
<img src="/screenshots/support/st4DebugOptions.png" class="screenshot" title="SmartTemplates Debug Options" alt="">
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Investigating the Error Log</h3>

<p>So once you have the error console set up, what can you do it? 
  Remember you have to always open the log window to start logging errors / activity so make sure you do this
	with Tools / Devloper Tools / Error Console just before you do the trouble shooting. 
</p>

<h4>STEP 1 - Setting up the Investigation</h4>

<p>If you want to start a fresh clean log it is always good to click the "Clear" button at the top immediately
   before you carry out the actions you investigate. Also make sure to not repeat the action do it once until
	 the problem happens. </p>

<h4>STEP 2 - Saving the Error Log</h4>

<p>
	 Then you need to copy the error log into a text file or email. Simply use the console
	 right-click menu and choose "Select All". Then "Copy". Do not take a screenshot of the error log as it is much 
	 harder to investigate - text is nice as you can search and order it!
	 You can always send us error logs in an email if you are having problems.	<br>
	 <img src="/screenshots/support/errorCopy.png" class="screenshot" title="Error Rightclick" alt=""><br>
	 <p>A note on typical Error messages: If there is a problem somewhere in Thunderbird code or an Add-on
	 then warnings and errors usually provide a location of where this happened.
	 If the location starts with "chrome://" you will know this happens in Thunderbird or and Add-on and not 
	 in a web page or within an email. The line number is also very helpful in tracking down particular issues.
	 </p>
	 <p>Any messages that we generate during "debug" logging typically look like this:
	 </p>
<pre class="code_block">SmartTemplates {FUNCTIONS.INSERTTEMPLATE} 14:2:39.705  [0 ms]	 
Add Signature... 
</pre>
<p>As you can see we start all our debug logs with the name of the addon (SmartTemplates).
   This can be followed by an optional {OPTION} which shows <a href="#debugOptions">which additional area we are debugging</a>.
	 This is then followed by a time stamp (14:2:39.705) and a time measurement [0 ms] since any previous operation. 
	 This makes it possible to pin point any operations that take unusually long. Underneath we show 
	 additional information about what smartTemplate is doing at the moment.
</p>

<h4>STEP 3 - Looking for Particular Problems</h4>
<p>When you have completed the logging phase, you can now use the "Errors", "Warnings" and "Messages" buttons 
   to filter out particular problems. You can also use the Search box if you like, e.g. you could type a keyword 
	 like "smarttemplate":<br>
  <img src="/screenshots/support/console2Search.png" class="screenshot" title="Console2 Search" alt="">
	<br>
	Note however this might actually hide the real cause of the problem so this is only for advanced users. 
	If you decide to send us a log, do not remove anything from it. To help us, just follow the initial instructions
	above and disable content logging and start with an empty log (only test one thing at a time).
</p>

<p>Now you get error entries inside Log Window listed like this example<br>
&#8658; This example shows a warning "yellow triangle" as result of JavaScript strict mode ("use strict"; &#8658; ECMAScript5) which we use<br>
  <img src="/screenshots/support/errorExample.png" class="screenshot" title="Error Example" alt="">
</p>

<p class="tip">
  <em>TIP:</em> By selecting Edit &#8658; Paste, these log entries can be inserted directly from your clipboard into your e-Mail to us or into a bug report on Bugzilla.
</p>

<p class="attention">
  <em>ATTENTION:</em> Please try not to send screen shots of error logs, but just the plain text messages 
	(console has select all / copy entries in it's right--click menu).
	It is likely that messages not constaining with  "chrome://<u>smarttemplate4</u>/.." are probably unrelated,
	but if they are errors or warning close to one of our own operations they may still be helpful.
