    <p>
      To Renew your license you can go to the SmartTemplates license tab and click the green renew / extend button.
      This will extend or renew your license so that you get at least a year extra usage (if your license
      expires in the future the year is added to that date) - even if you license is expired
      you will get a full year. It is important that you go through this process from the 
      SmartTemplates license screen as this is the only way to get the cheaper renewal price. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the renewal process, the old license will automatically be transmitted to the website
      to determine eligibility. That why there is no external link outside of the SmartTemplates
      Licensing screen to give you these special perks.

					 from (01/01 - 07/01). </p> 
					 -->
				<p>
				  Going Forward, SmartTemplates will <span class="emphasis">require a license</span> for continued use - the reason for this 
					is that unlike compiled software that runs on an operating system, the constant changes on the host mail software
					(Thunderbird) require substantial ongoing changes with a high effort; something which cannot be provided for free 
					("as in beer") anymore. You may have noticed many Add-on authors abandoning their Add-ons on Firefox and 
					Thunderbird because it was not possible for them to support their Add-ons anymore - this is directly caused
					by not trying to involve the users in funding the required work.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				  I tried to finance the changes with some extra features through the 
					<a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/smarttemplate4?referrer=st-contributepage-explain">SmartTemplates Pro license</a>, 
					but the adoption has been too low - it was not enough to warrant the many days spent on free support and writing features but now 
					on top fixing all the issues (and rewriting a lot of code) so that SmartTemplates continues to run on the
					Thunderbird 68 platform. Therefore I decided to add an affordable "Standard" License which will be required for continued
					use of this Add-on in the future. 
				</p>
				
				<p> Alternatively, you can buy the <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/smarttemplatestandard?referrer=st-contributepage-explain">standard license here</a>. 
				   This is now available at <span class="emphasis">a third of the price</span> of the Pro License.
				   It is valid for one full year after purchase, after which 
				   it can be extended for a lower price. It is highly likely that at this stage the Add-on needs to be
					 completely rewritten to keep working on a future version of Thunderbird, as the "classic Add-on" system
					 will be replaced with a different technology. Only through funding this work can SmartTemplates
					 survive - it may be the price of a cup of coffee to you but consider whether you think it is not worth 
					 supporting the many features that SmartTemplates gives you.<br>
					 If you cannot support it at the moment I would encourage you to look for a free replacement Add-on, such as quickText.
				</p>				
				
				
				<p> To get a license for SmartTemplates click on the rightmost tab on the settings dialog:
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;">
					<img style="max-width: 560px;" src="img/pro/smarttemplate-preferences-pro.png"  alt="How to buy a license from settings dialog"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				  This will bring you to the license page within Thunderbird, where you can select 
					the license most appropriate for you:
				</p>
				<p style="text-align:center;">
					<img style="max-width: 866px;" src="img/license-screen.png" alt="licensing dialog"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					It's the easiest way to get a license as you get to select an email address for registration and delivery.
					If you prefer, you can also go to the web shop directly: <br>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/smarttemplate4?referrer=st-contribute-page">Pro License</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/smarttemplatestandard?referrer=st-contribute-page">Standard License</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/instant/smarttemplate4domain?referrer=st-contribute-page">Domain License</a></li>
          </ul>
				</p>
				<p>
				  You can use  SmartTemplates on as many Thunderbird installations as you like as long 
					as it has your active, registered email address on it. Just select it from the account dropdown.
					The registration email address  is not  given to any third parties or used 
					for marketing purposes, it is only used for order fulfillment and license verification. Validation is 100% offline and your key is not transmitted 
					anywhere.

<p>
	What does it mean then, <em>free software</em> ??
</p>

<h3><em>Free</em> as in <em>Free Speech</em>, not <em>Free Beer</em>.</h3>

<p>
	The reason I am putting a lot of work into SmartTemplates is because I am using it every day, in order to make my daily work
	easier. I think it also important to share any tool that makes working easier and allow improvement of the tools.
</p>

<p>
	I think the most important aspect on free software is that it is a political statement to avoid the pitfalls of
	proprietary, monopoly driven software that coined terms such as "Embrace, Extend and Extinguish" and the innovation crippling
	model of patenting software (for further reading, please see links below).
	At the moment there is a conflict raging between the old proprietary model of software and the Free Software Concept,
	and its you, the users who will really decide where the future will take us. By downloading the Mozilla products and extensions by
	independant software developers, like SmartTemplates, you are actively helping the cause.
	<br>
	there is an excellent description of this concept here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" title="Philosophy of Free Software model" target="_blank">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="mini">
	Quote: <em>"Free software"</em> is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of <em>"free"</em> as in <em>"free speech,"</em> not as in <em>"free beer."</em><br>
	Free software is a matter of the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
</p>

<p>
	It is also important to note that you can always modify SmartTemplates as it is open source and send me improvement suggestions.
	Or you can use features in the existing software and use them in your own extension, provided you stick to the license
	(you can not create commercial versions of the extension and you need to attribute / credit the original authors).
	I have tried to make the code as readable as possible, so that you can check how SmartTemplates achieves its various goals.
</p>

<h2 class="page-header">The Web of Freedom - but how much longer?</h2>

<br>

<h3>What's happening right now?</h3>

<p>
	The American congress now tries to introduce censorship of the internet. <a href="http://vimeo.com/31100268" title="Censorship" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a>
</p>

<p class="iframe">
 <script type="text/javascript">embedVideo('http://player.vimeo.com/video/31100268?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0', 'Censorship Video', 560, 315);</script>
</p>

<p>
	The web is changing very massively over the last <script type="text/javascript">getDiff();</script> years. This requires rethinking on how we use this community resource.
	Community Sites are gaining a big amount of the power and the market share, the "login with facebook" idea
	is now trying to lock our identities into their systems; building huge silos that lock in our data in order to keep users "within" their systems;
	and while the web is still an open place and there are lots of "login with facebook" buttons, yet it has become increasingly difficult
	to move our own data, determine when and where it is used and stored. This is because in this new model, the users become the
	merchandise and the corporations become the customers. It is because in a "free" world this seems to be the only way to
	generate some revenue, and believe me that community sites such as facebook are _not_ there to server the users. Like anything else
	they are there to make money. The question is whether financing by loosing the ownership of one's own data and getting channeled into
	advertisment slots, is really the way we want to go?
</p>

<h3>We are not the product! We are the community!</h3>

<p>
	Mozilla is currently working on a new conecept called BrowserId, which aims to allow users to bring their data with them,
	makes sure the data is encrypted on the server so it cannot be abused or mined without the user's consent. It also should make
	it easier for the user to move the data across to a different community provider or remove it altogether. This is clearly not
	in the interest of the community sites themselves if they base their business model around being "the only one", but it is another
	necessary step for the webn to grow up, and for us users to emancipate ourselves from the providers.
</p>

<a id="donations"></a><!-- this anchor is just an in-page jump point, it doesn't need to contain anything -->
<h3>A word on donations</h3>

<p>
	I think that the donation model as such works, although I wish more people of the daily users (currently about 3,100) would take the
	time to donate some money. There is only a minute fraction who actually click the donation link. So, if you've found SmartTemplates to improve your work or business productivity,
	please take a moment. I _really_ appreciate the support. Thanks again in advance.
</p>
 
<p>
	One thing that I think is a bad idea is to try to use advertisement or constant "nagging" at the users in order to earn some money. The only time you will hear from me
	is when I release a new version, usually with new usability features and bug fixes.
	I am actively refusing extensions that try to do things like add advertisements, change browser links (by adding referrers) or redirect users in order to achieve
	this, there is a very fruitful discussion on the ATN Editors team who constantly review issues that the users bring to our attention
	around this topic.
</p>

<p>
	However, I also acknowledge that it is an inconvenience and a bit of a leap of faith to make a donation,
	so I would like to sincerely thank you for reading this and considering.
</p>

<p>
	Yours sincerely,
	<br>
	<span class="sigAxel">Axel</span>
