<h2 class="page-header">Stationery Support / External HTML Template Files</h2>

<p>Latest news: for Thunderbird 68, SmartTemplates has successfully added a file templating system. 
  This replaces Stationery which is not supporting Thunderbird 68 anymore. If you are still using 
	Thunderbird 60.8 or an earlier verison at this stage, you can read the documentation below. To move 
	forward into 2020, check out the "template files" feature in SmartTemplates instead:
</p>
<h3>How to use Template Files (instead of Stationery Ad-on)</h3>
<p>You select an external template via a dropdown on the reply / write or forward button:

<p>
  You can add a list of external HTML templates, integrated into the Write / Reply and Forward buttons, just like 
	with Stationery, by selecting the item <i>Template Files</i> from the accounts drop down:<br>
	<img src="/screenshots/fileTemplates.png" class="screenshot" alt="SmartTemplate - Template Files Integration" />
</p>
<p>
  Note: when using an external template file (just like with Stationery), then the account specific quote header 
  and template are ignored. If you need any SmartTemplate&#8308 variables, you can insert them directly in the
  HTML template file.

 <h3>What is Stationery?</h3>
 
<p>From version 0.9.3 onwards, SmartTemplates supports integration with the Stationery addon. 
This is made possible through some changes that <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/user/98987/" target="_blank" title="Visit arivald ATN Page">Arivald</a>, the owner of the Stationery extensions kindly added, 
and is available from version 0.8 of Stationery. 
</p>

 
 <p>Stationery is an addon that allows adding "outlook-style" stationery to your emails. 
    What's more, it can be very well used to create powerful mail templates for repetitive tasks
    such as sending out standard mails or replies; one thing that is missing in its functionality is
    the ability to add in a variety of mail header based variables, this is where SmartTemplates comes in.</p>

<p>Stationery uses HTML files as templates for mail. It allows using different templates in replies / forwarded mail
   and makes it possible to select the template using a simple click on a chevron beside the reply button:
   <br>
   <img src="/screenshots/stationery-dropDown.png" class="screenshot" alt="template selection" />
</p>

<p>Stationery also adds a handy html editing pane to the composer window; this alone makes it worth installing, 
   as it allows both simplifying and learning the html behind your email compositions:
   <br>
   <img src="/screenshots/stationery-html.png" class="screenshot" alt="template selection" />
</p>

<h3>How does SmartTemplates improve Stationery?</h3>
 
 <p>With the new global option "Support Stationery addon", SmartTemplates is now able to replace variables 
    from within Stationery files, like it does in your SmartTemplates settings. Once a user selects a Stationery template,
    the (identity-based) template of SmartTemplates will be ignored, and it will instead do its replacement
    work on the template provided by Stationery. This means you can now use all variables that you have been 
    using from within SmartTemplates, also within the Stationery.</p>

<p>To enable stationery support, go to <i>Stationery Options, Global Settings</i> and activate the option "Support Stationery addon": 
   <br>
   <img src="/screenshots/settingsStationery.png" class="screenshot" alt="enable stationery support" />
</p>

<p>We believe this is a very powerful feature which will benefit the users of both addons.
   I am already using it on a daily basis for replying to support mails.</p>
   
 <a id="howtoUse"></a><!-- this anchor is just an in-page jump point, it doesn't need to contain anything -->
 <h3>How do I use SmartTemplates with Stationery?</h3>
 
 <p>You can use pretty much all <a href="/variables.html">variables</a> directly in your stationery files. When you select a Stationery 
    during writing or replying to mail, then the <a href="/templates.html">SmartTemplates templates</a> which are bound to the account identity of
    your current email will be temporarily <i>ignored</i>. This means you do not need any special settings in quote / template as your Stationery 
	file supplies everything.
</P>
<p>	Instead SmartTemplates will search and replace the special
    header variables in the Stationery itself. This turns Stationery into a full blown templating application.</p>
<p> Additionally, you can use the following powerful <a href="/variables.html">variables</a> to control the content and behavior of your Stationery Template:</p>

<article>
 <ul>
   <li><code>%sig(HTML)%</code> / <code>%sig(Text)%</code> = Inserts Signature (will be read from Account Settings). Your signature may also contain other variables. 
          If you want st4 to replace variables in the signature, make sure to enable the option <i>Process signature</i> in
          SmartTemplates's advanced settings:<br>
          <img src="/screenshots/settings-process-sig.png" class="screenshot" alt="process signature" />
  </li>
  <li><code>%cursor%</code> = Controls where your cursor will go when the email body gets the focus</li>
  <li><code>%quotePlaceholder%</code> = Use this to determine where the text of the replied to mail should go. 
          Note that this can also be used by just selecting some text from the original email and then hitting reply: 
          only the selected portion will be quoted. Also, if you write a <i>new</i> email, the variable will simply be removed 
					(as there is nothing to quote).
  </li>
  <li><code>%quoteHeader%</code> = From version 0.9.4 we will support injecting the (processed) contents of our quote header box into the 
	    body of the Stationery. Interestingly the variable will only be filled in the cases <i>reply</i> and <i>forward</i>, and will simply
			be removed when writing a <i>new</i> email. This way you can use the same stationery for all cases.
	</li>
  <br>
   <span class="attention"><em>ATTENTION:</em>
     You cannot use <code class="inline">%quotePlaceholder%</code> or <code class="inline">%quoteHeader%</code> in SmartTemplates directly; it is only allowed in your Stationery files.
   </span>			
 </ul>
 <p>For a more complete list of variables that you can use in your Stationery, please read the <a href="/variables.html">variables page</a>.</p>
</article>

 <a id="example"></a><!-- this anchor is just an in-page jump point, it doesn't need to contain anything -->
 <h3>Example of a Stationery with SmartTemplates variables</h3>
 
 <p>Here is an example of a Stationery I use when I write support email. The quoted text is automatically inserted into the inner 
    container via <code class="inline">%quotePlaceholder%</code>. Also, <code class="inline">%subject%</code> is used to show the conversation title 
    in the top. Note that the signature (green box) is injected into the stationery using the <code class="inline">%sig(HTML)%</code> / <code class="inline">%sig(Text)%</code> variable. The signature
    itself also contains SmartTemplates variables (<code class="inline">%identity(name)%</code>).</p>
